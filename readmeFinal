Our program is written using python3.
In to run the program, use python3 assocmine.py <fileName.csv> <minSupport> <minConfidence> <additionalFile>
The first file must be in sparse vector format. Our program will not run with any other formats.
Additional file will depend on which file you are reading. For the bakery data set, it is goods.csv.
For the transcription data set, it is factors.csv. For the authors data set, it is authorlist.psv.
Example (not our actual minSupport and minConfidence): python 3 assocmine.py 1000-out1.csv 0.05 0.9 goods.csv
Enter a minConfidence for when computing the transcription data set, but it will not actually be taken in to account because
the transcription data set does not create association rules.

Running the program will create an output file that takes fileName and appends .out to it.

Extended Bakery: 

We ran 1000-out1.csv with minSupport 0.025 and minConfidence 0.9
Command: python3 assocmine.py 1000-out1.csv .025 .9 goods.csv

We ran 5000-out1.csv with minSupport 0.025 and minConfidence 0.9
Command: python3 assocmine.py 5000-out1.csv .025 .9 goods.csv

We ran 20000-out1.csv with minSupport 0.025 and minConfidence 0.9
Command: python3 assocmine.py 20000-out1.csv .025 .9 goods.csv

We ran 75000-out1.csv with minSupport 0.025 and minConfidence 0.9
Command: python3 assocmine.py 75000-out1.csv .025 .9 goods.csv

We selected a minSupport of 0.025 because it generated around 10 to 15 length 2 or greater skyline sets and 
0.9 because that created around 20 rules for each file.


Bingo Baskets:

we ran bingoBaskets.csv with minSupport 0.1 and minConfidence 0.5
Command: python3 assocmine.py bingoBaskets.csv 0.1 0.5 authorlist.psv

We selected minSupport of 0.1 to eliminate low support skyline sets and we selected minConfidence 0.5 to generate around
10-20 association rules.

Trasncription Data:

We ran factor_basket_sparse.csv with minSupport 0.93 and a random minConfidence.
Command: python3 assocmine.py factor_baskets_sparse.csv 0.93 0.5 factors.csv

We selected 0.93 to generate around 30 skyline item sets. The output file also contains genes that were present in every piece
of DNA. We did not include them in the other skyline item sets because it would be hard to read.
Also, when we calculated the skyline item sets for the transcription data, we saved all genes that appeared
in all market baskets and did not include them in the apriori algorithm. This allowed the apriori algorithm to finish.
